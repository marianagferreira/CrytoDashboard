# CrytoDashboard

This dashboard was developed with the intent of being a tool to assist financial analysts in making investment decisions.

The dashboard is divided in two main sections, a descriptive one and a predictive.
- The first, includes several relavnt variables and inidicators thay may contribute to analyse the market and make an informed decisin;
- The second, includes the prediction made by the pre developed ARIMA model, which has as an outuput the expected price for the following 30 days.

In order to make the dashboard interactive, it is possible to not only select which cryptocurrency is being analysed, but also the years being displayed.
Furthermore, the user can also choose between different charts, focused on different variables/indicators such as price, volume, moving average or even have the plot turn into a Candlestick chart. 

The following charts provide an overview of the current market situation. The first, on the left, is a tree map, with the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, which is updated everytime the dashboard runs, through the CoinMarketCap API. The second, on the right, is a table which lists all the cryptocurrecnies in analysis in this dashboard, and their respective prices, for the previous and current day. More relevant however, is the last column, which shows the percentual change in the price, and colour codes it,with green, a positive change, or red, a negative change.

The last visualization contains the price prediction for the chosen cryptocurrency for the next 30 days. The user can also hover the cursor over the line, to get the prediction for a specififc day.
