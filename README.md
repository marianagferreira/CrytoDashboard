- The second, includes the prediction made by the pre developed ARIMA model, which has as an outuput the expected price for the following 30 days.

In order to make the dashboard interactive, it is possible to not only select which cryptocurrency is being analysed, but also the years being displayed.
Fruthermore, the user can also choose between different charts, focused on different variables/indictors such as price, volume, moving average or even have the plot turn into a Candlestick chart.
